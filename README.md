# Secret Sharing

This project implements secret sharing schemes, including Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) and Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS). The algorithms allow a secret to be divided into parts, where a certain number of parts are required to reconstruct the original secret.

## Features

-   Shamir's Secret Sharing:

    -   Divides a secret into multiple shares.
    -   Any specified number of shares (threshold) can be used to reconstruct the secret.

-   Verifiable Secret Sharing:
    -   Extends Shamir's scheme to allow verification of shares.
    -   Ensures integrity and authenticity of the shares before reconstruction.

## Prerequisites

-   Go 1.16 or higher
-   A working Go environment set up on your machine
